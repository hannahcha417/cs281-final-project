You also show some awareness of the complexities involved in determining what qualifies as historic, and you mention relevant issues such as funding challenges and standards for deeming a building historic. \n\nHowever, there are several areas for improvement. First, your thesis, while present, remains somewhat vague and unfocused\u2014phrases like \"the value of laws that are put into place\" do not clearly state your position or take a definitive stance on whether such laws are ultimately beneficial or problematic. To earn the full point for thesis, you should make an explicit, defensible claim that clearly responds to the prompt\u2014such as arguing that preservation laws are essential to cultural heritage or that they present challenges that outweigh their benefits.\n\nSecond, your evidence includes references to Sources D, B, and F, but your explanation of how this evidence supports your claims is often superficial or disconnected. For example, when discussing challenges (Source D), you mention issues but do not clearly connect these to why laws are necessary or beneficial despite those challenges. Similarly, your example of Source F's object\u2014the man in a chair\u2014is interesting but not fully integrated into your argument about the importance of specific laws. Providing more detailed analysis of how these sources specifically bolster your line of reasoning would strengthen your essay.\n\nFinally, your writing can benefit from improved clarity, organization, and grammatical precision.

Your essay shows an attempt to connect evidence to your claims, especially when discussing how laws can help mitigate issues related to inconsistent standards and subjective preservation decisions. However, there are areas where your essay could be strengthened significantly. \n\nFirstly, your thesis presents a defensible position\u2014that the value of preservation laws is high\u2014but it would benefit from clearer articulation early on to guide your argument more explicitly. For example, explicitly stating your position in a single, focused thesis statement at the beginning would help the reader follow your reasoning.\n\nSecondly, your evidence draws from multiple sources, which is good, but your explanations of how this evidence supports your claims are often vague or surface-level. For example, when referencing Source D and Source B, try to more clearly connect how these sources demonstrate the necessity or benefits of laws, rather than merely describing the issues. Including specific details from the sources\u2014such as exact survey findings, standards listed, or examples\u2014would make your support more compelling.\n\nThirdly, the organization of your essay could be improved. Your ideas jump from challenges in preservation to standards and then the object of preservation, but these points could be more coherently structured to build a stronger line of reasoning. Consider creating distinct paragraphs for each main idea, with clear topic sentences, and ensure your commentary consistently explains how each piece of evidence advances your thesis.\n\nLastly, the essay contains numerous grammatical, mechanical, and stylistic errors that hamper clarity\u2014such as inconsistent punctuation, awkward phrasing, and misspellings (\"thigs\" instead of \"things,\" \"historification\" which is awkward, and \"the pronoun\" which is unclear). Proofreading and revising for clarity and correctness would elevate the quality of your writing.\n\nRegarding sophistication, your essay seeks to engage with complex ideas about the criteria for historic designation and the ethical implications of preservation, but these points remain underdeveloped. To score higher, you should explore these ideas more deeply, perhaps considering counterarguments or limitations of laws, which would demonstrate a more nuanced understanding.\n\nOverall, your essay addresses the prompt with some evident understanding, but it would benefit from clearer thesis development, more specific evidence with analytical commentary, organized structure, and careful editing for language.", "grade": 3}

Thesis and Focus: Your thesis, \"the value of laws that are put into place to preserve buildings of historic importance is relatively high as change is a necessity,\" is somewhat vague and does not clearly take a stand on the importance of preservation laws specifically. An effective thesis should directly state why these laws are valuable, perhaps acknowledging challenges but emphasizing their significance.\n\n2. Evidence and Explanation: While you cite sources, your explanations often lack depth. For example, when referencing Source D's survey, you mention issues like funding and development pressures but don\u2019t explore how laws mitigate these issues or why that makes laws valuable. Similarly, your discussion of Source B's standards for historic designation would benefit from elaboration on how laws clarify these standards and why that\u2019s important.\n\n3. Organization and Development: The structure is somewhat scattered, and your reasoning jumps between ideas (challenges, standards, object preservation) without clear transitions or an overarching line of reasoning. Strengthening your essay with clearer topic sentences and transitions would improve coherence.\n\n4. Clarity and Language: There are grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout (e.g., \"building that are of historic value\" should be \"buildings that are of historic value,\" and \"the pronoun, and need for these laws are of high value\" is unclear).

This would make your stance clearer and more focused.\n\nSecond, while you reference sources and some evidence, your explanation of how this evidence supports your argument is limited. For example, you mention that Source D discusses issues like funding and development pressures, but you do not explicitly connect how laws would mitigate these challenges. Similarly, your discussion of standards (Source B) could be enhanced by explaining how specific laws provide clarity and prevent subjective or arbitrary decisions, reinforcing the importance of legal standards.\n\nThird, your coverage of the sources occasionally lacks depth, and your examples could be more specific. For instance, the mention of the man petitioning to save a non-historic object (Source F) is somewhat illustrative but would be stronger if you elaborated on how laws prevent such subjective decisions and why that matters.\n\nFinally, your writing mechanics need improvement. Errors such as \"buildings of historic importance,\" \"go into deciding/whether,\" and inconsistent punctuation hinder clarity and professionalism. Attention to grammar, sentence structure, and word choice will make your argument more compelling and easier to follow.\n\nOverall, your essay shows a reasonable understanding of the sources and the issue but would benefit from a clearer thesis, deeper analysis, and more precise explanations to fully develop your line of reasoning.", "grade": 3}

You identify important challenges associated with preservation and the need for clear standards, which is a positive foundation for your argument. However, there are several areas needing improvement. Your thesis is somewhat vague; while you state the importance of preservation laws, you do not clearly articulate your position or take a strong stance. This makes your response less convincing as a defensible argument and limits the clarity of your line of reasoning. Additionally, your evidence references the sources but often lacks in-depth explanation of how that evidence directly supports your claims. For example, you mention challenges like lack of funding and the importance of standards but do not fully develop why these issues make laws \"of high value\" or the implications thereof. Your essay would benefit from more precise reasoning and stronger connections between your evidence and your claims. Finally, some grammatical and mechanical issues, such as sentence structure and word choice, hinder clarity and the overall effectiveness of your writing. To improve, focus on crafting a clear, defensible thesis early in your essay, develop stronger explanations of how your evidence supports your reasoning, and work on editing for grammatical accuracy.
