Due to the ever and always changing society that is the world of today, the value of laws that 
are put into place to preserve buildings of historic importance is relatively high as change is a 
necessity.

The value of preservation laws for historic buildings is high due to the amount of challenges that 
come with preservation. Source D shows the issues associated with preservation. It explains, through
survey results, that the issues range from a lack of funding to pressures from new developments 
to lack of diversity and education. Because of these challenges that are present when going through
the process of preservation for building that are of historic value, putting laws in place that support 
that should be of high value and importance.

The value of preservation laws for historic buildings is high because of the amount of disparity when
it comes to deeming things historic. Having precise laws that are clear about the standards and specifications
needed to be considered historic is important and would make them of high value. Source B explains the 
difficulty of considering/deeming thigs historic. It explains some of the standards, such as associated
history or location, that go into deciding whether or not a building is historic. Having specific laws that
clearly describe the specifications and standards are of high value. This is because it is a pronoun, and 
need for these laws are of high value and the problem requires immediate response. Source F shows the type of 
objects that could get deemed historic should specific laws not be put into place. Source F shows a man sitting
in a chari, that has no immediately recognizable important features or conditions or importance that would
qualify it to be deemed historic, yet, he is petitioning for it to be saved regardless. The historification
of objects just because we like them is not the reason historic preservation happens. This is why there is
a high value in laws that are in place for preservation.
